# Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to the Foundry Framework! The contribution guide can be found in the Foundry Framework documentation.

# Credits
Whilst the Foundry Framework was developed in-house at Co-Foundry, South Africa, we would like to give special thanks to the Laravel community for all their hard work in building many of the packages used. 

Without shared development, the Foundry Framework would have taken a much longer time to build and who knows... it may never even have been built if it wasn't for the community.

Lastly, we would like to thank Taylor Otwell and the Laravel core developers for their hard work. Without you, this Framework wouldn't be here!
