# Frontend Framework
One of the other goals of the Foundry Framework is to provide building blocks to creating any type of "application".

Using VueJS plugins and components makes this possible, and most of any Foundry Framework frontend development around applications uses this approach. 

## VueJS Packages
Each Foundry Framework Module can optionally provide a VueJS package plugin that can be used in a themes dependencies and imported to that code base.
